## What Does It Do?

AI Companion lets you have conversations with an AI assistant. You can choose from different personalities to change how the AI responds - whether you want a helpful teacher, a creative storyteller, or just a friendly chat companion.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

1. **API Key**: You'll need a Groq API key (it's free to get one at groq.com)
2. **Python installed on your computer**

### Setup

1. Create a file called `api_key.json` in the same folder as the app
2. Add your API key to it like this:
   ```json
   {
     "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
   }
   ```
3. Double-click `main.pyw` to start the app

## How to Use

You can create your own custom personalities:

You can also edit or delete existing personalities using the buttons in the personality manager.

## Tips
